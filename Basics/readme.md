## 📌 What is CSS?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a website. CSS allows developers to separate content (HTML) from design, making websites more flexible and easier to maintain.

## 🏛️ The 3 Pillars of a Website

Every website is built on three core pillars:

1. **HTML (Structure)**: The backbone of a website, defining the content and structure.
2. **CSS (Presentation)**: The styling layer that makes the website visually appealing.
3. **JavaScript (Behavior)**: Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website.

These three technologies work together to create modern, functional, and beautiful websites.
